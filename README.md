# Guest List App

This is a simple web app where you can add, edit, and delete guests for an event. You can also mark if they are attending or not. The app saves your guest list in your browser, so it doesn’t go away when you refresh the page.

## What You Can Do

- Add a guest to your list
- Edit a guest's name
- Delete a guest from the list
- Mark if the guest is attending or not
- Keep your guest list saved in your browser
- Shows a message when there are no guests yet
- Limits the list to 10 guests

## What This Project Uses

- HTML – for the structure of the page
- CSS – to make it look nice
- JavaScript – to make things work (add/edit/delete/save)
- Local Storage – so your list stays even after closing the tab

## Files

- `index.html` – The main webpage
- `index.css` – The styles (colors, layout, etc.)
- `index.js` – The code that makes the app work
- `README.md` – This file that explains the project

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the project
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. Start typing in a guest name and click “Add Guest”
4. Use the Edit, Delete, and RSVP buttons to manage your list

## Notes

- You can only add up to **10 guests**
- Guest names can’t be empty
- All your data stays in your browser (it doesn’t go to a server)
- Refreshing the page won’t delete your list

## Ideas for Future

- Add a search bar to find guests
- Sort guests by name or RSVP
- Add a button to clear the full list
